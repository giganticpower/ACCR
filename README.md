An End-to-end Text Spotting Model for Shipping Container Codes

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end text spotting framework for spotting multi-directional and multi-line container codes in complex scenes.


It will release the dataset of the ACCR soon. The data is collected by us and has been labeled.

Thanks, authors.
